# How to crackme
## Hello there, so this is my write-up about how I successfully cracked the binaries a.k.a crackme(s) provided in a task by Fedora Project in [Google Code-In 2019](https://codein.withgoogle.com).
First of all let's download the binaries and cd into the directory where we have downloaded the binary. For the sake of convenience, I have downloaded all the three binaries. Make note that we will be using some utilities to crack these binaries like:
1. ltrace
2. strings
3. Ghidra or Radare2 (cutter)
## The hash symbol [#] means that this step neads to be repeated for all the binaries

## ./1stcrackme

### Who are you ./1stcrackme?
Well, just staring at this file cannot give us any idea of what this binary is, let's do a quich recon on what this file is, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ file ./1stcrackme
```
![file](img/file.png)
Okay, so this output tells us that this binary is a ELF 64-bit LSB shared object.

### Let's try to execute the first binary by using the following command:

```bash
$ ./1stcrackme
```
![exec](img/exec.png)

which gives us an annoying behavior but a necessary one. Let's give this binary the executable permissions to this binary using the following command [#1] :

```bash
$ sudo chmod +x ./1stcrackme
```

### Fair enough, let's run the binary using the follwing command [#1] :

```bash
$ ./1stcrackme
```
![out](img/out.png)

So with this output on the terminal, we can conclude two thing, either the binary accepts three passwords, or it retries the password attempts thrice and if the password is incorrect even on the third attempt, the binary will exit. 
Not to make it late, let's make the use of ```strings``` utility which I have mentioned before, what it does is that it prints all the printable "strings" in the file. To use this utility, type in the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ sudo strings ./1stcrackme
```
The output is huge, like seriously HUGE, so not to make this write-up an horror for your mouse wheel/down arrow, let me attach a screenshot:

![strings](img/strings.png)

Interesting, quite a good amount of readable/understandable data, going through all the data (a.k.a gibberish for non CSE folks) and after taking a close look, we have found something very interesting! 

![pass1](img/pass1.png) 

Voil√†! We have found the password to this binary! Let's fire up the binary and try this password:

![try1](img/pass_found.png)

Okay so this was the correct password but hold on, we are getting prompt to add another password followed by another prompt, according to which our first assumption was absolutely correct that this binary has three passwords.
What next? Well the ```ltrace``` utility is here to save our day! What it does is is search for the ```strcmp``` calls which compares the input with strings already specified. Use the following command to get started:

```bash
$ ltrace ./1stcrackme
```
As we know the first password i.e. **FEDORAGCIPASSEASY**, we need to feed that as the input end hit Enter,here's what we have got

![ltrace1](img/ltrace1.png)

Note that how the **```ltrace```** utilility traces the **```strcmp```** calls and how **```strcmp```** compares our input with the already stored input. But what for the next two passwords? As we already know that the **```strcmp```** function will compare our input with the already stored **string**, let's blindly enter any string that we wish to. I will feed **hellow** to the next two password prompts and this is what we have come up with.

![ltrace2](img/ltrace2.png)

Notice how the string are getting compared again, so for the first **hellow** or the second password, our given input is compared with the hex value **0x1337**, for the second **hellow** or the third password,our given input is compared with the hex value **0x133337** let's make use of the web to convert this hexacdecimal to integer value:

![hex1](img/hex1.png)

![hex2](img/hex2.png)

And we have come to know that **0x1337** is 4919 and **0x133337** is 1258295, let's try these decimal values as the password:
![badnews](img/badnews.png)

What is up! The thing is that overthinking often messes up with the easiest routes, actually **0x1337** and **0x133337** is itself a string, let's try using these as strings:
![success](img/success.png)
There we go! Wooo 


## ./2ndcrackme

### Who are you ./2ndcrackme?
Well, just staring at this file cannot give us any idea of what this binary is, let's do a quich recon on what this file is, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ file ./2ndcrackme
```

And again this output tells us that this binary is a ELF 64-bit LSB shared object.

### Let's run the binary using the follwing command [#2] :

```bash
$ ./2ndcrackme
usage:
./2ndcrackme <password>
```

And we've come to know that we have to feed the password as an argument, as we have zero idea of what the password can be, let's try **```strings```** utility yet another time: 

```bash
$ strings ./2ndcrackme
```

![2ndbin](img/2ndstrings.png)

Interesting again! We have found the string **FEd0raGCH** quite suspicious, let's try to pass this as the password:

![pass2wrong](img/pass2wrong.png)

Not again! But nothing to worry because **```ltrace```** the saviour is here to help us out, let's feed **hello** as the password argument: 

```bash
$ ltrace ./2ndcrackme hello
```

![2ndltrace](img/2ndltrace.png)

And here we have found quite interesting, the 2nd binary is not supposed to be that easy to crack but still, let's try this **FEd0raGCIt@sk** as the password:

```bash
$ ./2ndcrackme FEd0raGCIt@sk
Success
```

![bruhmoment](img/bruhmoment.png)

### Bruh moment :3 We sucessfully cracked the 2nd binary

## ./3rdcrackme

### Who are you ./3rdcrackme?
Well, just staring at this file cannot give us any idea of what this binary is, let's do a quich recon on what this file is, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ file ./3rdcrackme
```

And for the second time this output tells us that this binary is a ELF 64-bit LSB shared object.

### Let's run the binary using the follwing command [#3] :

```bash
$ ./3rdcrackme
Enter the password! hello

Checking password...

Login failed!
```
![3rdbin](img/3rdprompt.png)

And we've come to know that we have to feed the password when prompted, let's try **```strings```** utility yet another time: 

```bash
$ strings ./3rdcrackme
```

![3rdbing](img/secret.png)

Interesting but suspicious! We have found the string **The password is: FEDORAPASSWORDGCI!**, definitely not so easy but let's try to pass this as the password:

![pass3wrong](img/pass3.png)

As expected! But **```ltrace```** is here once again, let's feed **hello** as the password argument: 

```bash
$ ltrace ./3rdcrackme hello
```

![3rdltrace](img/3rdltrace.png)

Okayyy.....So we have got nothing interesting but something very interesting this time! We can notice a **```memcmp```** function in use which basically compares the size of two buffers passed to it as the parameters, it takes **three parameters**, the first two parameter are the pointers to the memory that we want to compare and the third parameter is the size of that memory in bytes. For better understanding of the code, let's fire up [Ghidra SRE Tool](https://ghidra-sre.org/) 
Installation can be found at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJlKtRgC68U) link 
After downloading and configuring Ghidra SRE Tool, it's time to run it:

```bash
$ ./ghidraRun
```
We need to take care of a few more things like how to start our code analysis, below are step by step screenshots of how to configure our project:

1. First create a New Project and click on **Non-Shared Project** and click **Next**
![ghidra](img/ghidra.png)

2. Next open up your file manager and drag-drop the binary on the project name that you specified, for me it is **3rdcrackme** as you can see in the screenshot below

![feed](img/ghidrafeed.png)

3. Up next we'll get a prompt if we wish to analyze this binary, which obviously has to be *Yes*

![analyze](img/analyze.png)

4. Up next you'll be prompted with another **Analysis Options** window in which we will check mark the *Decompiler Parameter ID* for better analysis and click on *Analyze*

![ID](img/ID.png)

5. Let's now look for the *main()* function, this can be found under the *Symbol Tree* window in the left hand side of the screen.

![symboltree](img/symboltree.png)

6. Click on **main()** to get the decompiled code on the right side of the screen, here's what we get:

![code](img/code.png)

Well the code is pretty simple and not very different than what we found in the **```ltrace```** of the binary. And this can lead to a Buffer Overflow! So let's try feeding a long input in the password prompt:

![bof](img/bof.png)

## Wow! That was freakin' awesome! We successfully cracked the third binary by actually exploiting a vulnerability in the code that lead to memory corruption as we used more memory than the memory allocated
